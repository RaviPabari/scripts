The upower command-line tool helps extract information related to the power source (batteries). It provides an interface to list down all the power sources of your PC or laptop.

upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0

upower -i `upower -e | grep 'BAT'`

upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT) | grep --color=never -E "state|to\ full|to\ empty|percentage"

The above are three different ways of using acpi command to find power source information.


Use cat and find

The “cat” and “find” commands also help find details about your battery and power source.

Syntax

For the battery capacity, the syntax would be:

cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity


For more detailed battery information use the find command.

Syntax

And the syntax is,

find /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/ -type f | xargs -tn1 cat
